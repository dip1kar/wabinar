Here,we uploaded two code files and the screenshot of the output pop-up window.

The form1.cs file contains the authentication code and form2.cs contains barcode generation code.
Authentication is to restrict un-authorised person to access to the content of barcode.

The Barcode.png file shows the schema of the database table 'Mypicture', where barcode is stored in hashcode form.
